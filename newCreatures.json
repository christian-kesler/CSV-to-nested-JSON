							"subcontent" : "The unusual horns of an Azure Dragon have been observed as powerful goring weapons while providing a defensive deterrent against attacks targeting the head and neck.  Azure Dragons have also been known to use their horns to overturn rocks and logs in pursuit of bugs when young, and almost constantly strip trees of branches and bark from a very early age.  After doing so, the dragon will sometimes gnaw at the bark, but most scholars agree that the purpose of the initial act is to keep the horns sharp and strong.  This theory is supported by observations stating that sufficiently large dragons will instead scrape their horns against mountainside rock structures in a similar fashion despite the fact they have claws more than capable of stripping bark from trees.  <br><br>The scales of an Azure Dragon are notably lightweight and strong, being an exceptional material of choice for light armors.  While not as strong as the scales of other dragons, the Azure Dragons is able to grow large layered plates without sacrificing mobility due to the pliant nature of the scale material, which is by far the most flexible dragon scale material discovered to date.  <br><br>Mobility seems to be the Azure Dragons chief evolutionary concern, being markedly faster and lighter than other dragons.  The exception to this theme of sleek and fast appears to be entirely in the shoulders, neck, and head.  Azure Dragons have remarkably strong necks, likely a result of their constant thrusting and scraping with their horns.  They also have powerful shoulders and wing muscles, likely a result of their heightened proclivity for high altitude flight for extended durations.  "

Wolves tend to keep their distance from dragons, but Mountain Lions, Snow Leopards, and other predatory cats are all too eager to hunt Azure Dragon Hatchlings.  Azure Dragons learn to fly at a younger age than other dragon species, helping them avoid the threat of felines.  However, they end up exposing themselves to a new, albeit lesser, threat; Hawks and Eagles.  Birds of Prey tend not to be cannibalistic, but dragons possess reptilian elements that make them appealing to these predators.  Some scholars believe that an Azure Dragon Hatchling can look similar to a salmon or trout from above, which are the natural prey of Eagles.  Azure Dragon Hatchlings quickly learn to keep an eye out for airborn threats, opting to fly higher and higher as they grow.  <br><br>Azure Dragon Hatchlings prefer to feed on bugs and small rodents, greatly preferring to hunt small birds once they learn to fly sufficiently well.  Once the Azure Dragon becomes a Juvenile, they no longer have any natural predators, although a provoked bear can often drive them off.  At this point, the dragon begins hunting larger birds like the Eagles and Hawks that plagued them when younger.  As they grow and birds can no longer sustain them, they also begin hunting larger mammals such as deer, mountain goats, and eventually, moose.  "

They turn their attention to birds after learning to fly, attacking from below by flying upwards with remarkable speed.  This is often successful since birds are typically wary of threats from above while flying, not below.  Juveniles hunt birds of prey usiong an opposite strategy, by flying higher and diving down upon them.  These targets are often surverying what is below them, rarely looking up.  Regardless of the direction the dragon comes from, the attack involves slamming their powerful head into the target with concussive force.  Their horns gore the target, which the dragon commits to by thrusting their head up and down quickly right after impact.  This is enough to kill some birds instantly, crippling most others.  It's an easy matter to glide after their limp body and snatch them out of the air.  <br><br>Once too old to rely on birds alone, the dragon turns its attention to mountain goats and deer.  Their hunting strategy at this point involves gliding down at remarkable speed before goring and bashing the target with their horns.  This strategy is effective, but once mastered, the dragon will sometimes glide overhead and smack the goat with its tail to send it tumbling down the cliffside.  It's believed the dragon finds this amusing.  "

Then, upon meeting, the dragons size each other up with a ritual that seems like a dance.  The utility of this dance is still a mystery, but it clearly has significance; if it goes badly, they might break out into an all out brawl.  Afterwards, if everything goes smoothly, the resident shows the visitor their cathedral lair and they discuss the resident's religious doctrine at length.  If the visitor finds the cathedral and doctrine satisfactory, they agree to become mated.  This involves the two sharing territory and cathedrals, although the resident remains the Mahant (deity priest) while the visitor becomes the Bhagat (a similar title, but secondary in terms of rank).

They greatly prefer to enslave aquatic mortals, but even that is a rare occurence.

They typically decorate their lair with sunken vessels and the corpses of their mightiest foes.  "

							"subcontent" : "Turquoise Dragons have the standard six limbed anatomy typical of their species, although they are more flexible and serpentine in their movements than their brethren.  They are covered in vibrant sea green scales, hence the name.  Their wings are conventional in structure, but have thicker, fleshier membranes than their batlike cousins.  The underside of their wing membrane is a dull ivory color, much like a barnacle.  A series of ivory colored vanes run along the Dragon's spine, culminating in a moderately sized central head crest.  Two vanes extend downwards from the Dragon's cheekbones, while a pair of rearfacing horns swoop back from the base of the skull.  The Turquoise Dragon's tail ends with a series of flexible tendrils akin to a jellyfish, which are only a shade more pale than the vanes.  "
						},
						{
							"subheading" : "Anatomy",
							"subcontent" : "Turquoise Dragons are anatomically similar to sharks in a number of ways.  Firstly, their scales are much smaller than those of other dragons, being a series of tightly packed sharp dermal denticles rather than large layered plates.  This results in skin that appears smooth, but can tear open unprotected flesh should it rub against it with force.  Their bones are also far more flexible due to high levels of cartilage composition.  This allows the Turquoise Dragon to much more easily shrug of bludgeoning impacts, but makes it harder for them to maintain sustained flight over long distances.  While their wings are powerful, they are best suited for short bursts of flight and aquatic navigation; the flexibility of their skeleton makes endurance flight require far more effort.  Turquoise Dragons also have a series of ever replenishing teeth that move forward as they grow.  While this process is similar to that which sharks undergo, the functionality of the Dragon's jaws are more akin to a large constrictor snake.  The smaller teeth that have yet to move forward serve as one way skewers, preventing anything in the Dragon's mouth from sliding out once it's been latched onto.  <br><br>Lastly, Turquoise Dragons have a set of robust gills, although not in the typical sense.  The ivory colored membranes, underbelly, and tail vanes of the Turquoise Dragon serve to pull oxygen from the surrounding water at an alarming rate.  Turquoise Dragons have remarkable endurance when underwater, which is likely due to their heightened ability to satisfy their cardiovascular system.  While the tail vanes of a Turquoise Dragon do serve as gills in some sense (and the most robust of the Dragon's gills at that), they also serve another purpose; they are visually and functionally similar to a jellyfish's stingers, containing a series of neurotoxins that inflict an immobilizing surge of pain.  While the toxins employed are not among the most powerful when compared to jellyfish, the effect of the tail is sufficient to partially paralyze or numb an area roughly one tenth of the Dragon's size.  The duration of this effect varies based on the Dragon's age, with Hatchlings and Juveniles only inflicting it for a few seconds, while the sting from Wyrms can linger for days.  "

Hatchlings hunt fish while doing their best to avoid predators.  Juvenile Turquoise Dragons are especially aggressive hunters, preferring to hunt small predators and frequently attacking things as large or larger than they are.  They sometimes succeed by using their psychic blast and tail stingers to gain an advantage, but lose just as often.  Turquoise Dragons have no issue with fleeing a fight, becoming even more adept at escaping than they are at hunting.  Once the Dragon is an Adult, it is capable of hunting all but the greatest sharks with ease.  At this age, they clash with similarly sized foes less often, but still actively go after orcas and dire squids when they can.  Adult Dragons are still wary of large lurking threats, such as sperm whales and dire sharks.  By the time the Dragon is a Wyrm, they have very very few natural predators remaining.  Only the greatest aquatic monsters such as the Kraken or Leviathan could make a Turquoise Wyrm flee in a one on one encounter.  "

Under the Dragon's guidance and control, they reform their coral structures and hew away the stone to create magnificent structures for the lair.  As a result, Tuquoise Dragon lairs end up appearing as opulent palaces formed entirely of coral.  The largest known Turquoise Dragon lair was discovered off the coast of Westcrown, and was originally thought to be an abandoned city for merpeople.  "

Viridian Dragons keep to themselves and guard their chosen territory with relentless cunning and brutality.  They have been commonly known to allow nomads passage through their territory, and even allow hunters to stalk their territory if they are deemed worthy and respectful of the nature around them.  In many ways, Viridian Dragons are literal guardians of nature itself, behaving as ethical stewards of their land while living off of it.  Stories of Viridian Dragons that have saved herds of deer from raging dire crocodiles or feral therianthropes are not uncommon, with the dragon leaving the herd intact afterwards in most cases.  Their fearsome appearance and large menacing horn often provokes conflict with those who are unfamiliar with their nature, especially mercenaries or soldiers who are unknowingly trespassing.  "

Bronze Dragons usually procure treasure from sunken vessels and return it to the rigthful owner with fees for their service removed, allowing them to amass small fortunes that they then use to invest in seafaring cargo shipment companies.  You would be hard pressed to find a mercantile coster with seafaring vessels that doesn't have the financial backing of a Bronze Dragon.  While Bronze Dragons do value civility and order as any Metallic Dragon would, they hold a remarkably potent resentment for pirates.  Gold Dragons are widely considered the most brutal and vengeful of the Metallic Dragons, but accounts of Bronze Dragons razing pirate vessels certainly makes them a competitor for that heading.  "

They constantly redecorate and cycle through their collection to adorn their lair in different combinations from year to year, sometimes forgetting about pieces they own that are buried in the back of their storage chambers.  There have been relics from cultures thousands of years old found in Brass Dragon hoards, and they are just as prone to give it away as they are to defend it with their lives.  As unreliable as Brass Dragons may be, any city fortunate enough to find a Brass Dragon setting up permanent residence within its walls is sure to find itself much wealthier as it becomes a central hub of culture and expression.
