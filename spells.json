By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.<br><br>    The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.<br><br> Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:<br><br>      You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.<br><br>    You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.<br><br>    You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.<br><br> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.<br><br> You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.<br><br>   You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.<br><br>   The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress."

You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.  When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose.  You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.  Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.  Corridors.  Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily obscured.  In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.  Doors.  All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell.  In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.  Stairs.  Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell.  These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.  Other Spell Effect.  You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.  Place dancing lights in four corridors.  You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.  Place magic mouth in two locations.  Place stinking cloud in two locations.  The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.  Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.  Place a suggestion in one location.  You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.  The whole warded area radiates magic.  A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.  You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.  "

					"content" : "A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you.  This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse.  Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane.  Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.  Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it.  A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed.  While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.  Targeted Effects.  Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.  Areas of Magic.  The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere.  If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.  For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.  Spells.  Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.  Magic Items.  The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.  For example, a longsword, +1 in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.  A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.  If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.  Magical Travel.  Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel.  A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.  Creatures and Objects.  A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.  Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.  Dispel Magic.  Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.  Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other.  "

The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target.  Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.  The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.  Chaining.  Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place.  The target is restrained until the spell ends, and it can't move or be moved by any means until then.  The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of precious metal.  Hedged Prison.  The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel.  The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of your choice.  The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature representation of the prison made from jade.  Minimus Containment.  The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object.  Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel.  The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.  The special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.  Slumber.  The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.  The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.  Ending the Spell.  During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target.  The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.  The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit points.  A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.  You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time.  If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.  "

Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range.  The wall remains in place for the duration.  If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.  The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet.  You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm.  If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.  The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color.  When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers.  As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.  The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer.  Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell.  Antimagic field has no effect on the wall, and dispel magic can affect only the violet layer.  1.  Red.  The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  While this layer is in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall.  The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.  2.  Orange.  The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  While this layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall.  The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.  3.  Yellow.  The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.  4.  Green.  The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.  5.  Blue.  The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.  6.  Indigo.  On a failed save, the creature is restrained.  It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.  If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends.  If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified condition.  The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind.  While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall.  The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.  7.  Violet.  On a failed save, the creature is blinded.  It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn.  A successful save ends the blindness.  If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the GM's choosing and is no longer blinded.  (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal Planescapes.  ) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.
